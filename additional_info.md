# Version history

## Version 2.0 (October 2024)
- CRACMM2 released in CMAQv5.5

## Version 2.0-alpha (in progress February 2024)
- Collecting updates leading to CRACMM2 

## Version 1.0 (October 2022)
- Final version for release in CMAQv5.4 
- ROCALK names updated

## Version 0.3
- Renamed HC8 to HC10
- Renamed ROCN/P series to ROCN/PALK
- Synced with latest CMAQ version of chemistry and metadata

## Version 0.24 
- Renamed toluene surrogate (explicit) to TOL
- Added flowchart

## Skip v0.23

## Version: 0.22
- Renamed XYOP to XYE to avoid overlap with name of existing peroxy radical.

## Version: 0.21
- This version used to create initial SMOKE inputs.
- Known issues: 
  - XYOP emitted species name overlaps with a peroxy radical in RACM2. XYOP renamed to XYE (major contributors are o-xylene and ethylbenzene).
  - TOLUENE named to TOL in later versions.
- Date: 20210812. Updated carbons (Speciation Tool input) for missing species.
- Date: 20210806. Updated Misc Silanes surrogate and removed non-ROC species from mech4import.
- Date: 20210805. Mineral oil surrogate changed from decane to linoleic acid (mapping changed from HC8 to ROCP1). 8 new SPECIATE species added.

## Version: 0.2
Date: 20210716

* PAH eliminated. The most abundant species that was in PAH fit better in the existing oxygenated aromatics. When PAHs were defined with O:C=0, very little mass was left. 
* NAPH includes small amounts of O:C=0 PAHs.
* Propylene glycol (and potential one other species) is now explicit as PROG.
* FURAN has been fully implemented as a species.
* S/IVOCs are now called ROC species. IVOCOXY is now ROCIOXY.
* SVOC ROC binning now occurs before single-ring aromatic mapping.
* ROCP4ARO was eliminated due to lack of significant emissions and OA potential.
* Glycoaldehyde was moved from ALD to GLY to better represent its solubility.
* Silanes and siloxanes of any volatility are ROCIOXY.
* UNKCRACMM is now used for non-carbon-containing species and elemental carbon (and TC).
* DIEN has been deleted. Small amount of anthropogenic dienes appear in FURAN. BDE13 is the major anthropogenic diene and already explicit.
* Some representative compounds (SPECIATE) have been updated: OC, NCOM, POC, PNCOM.


## Version 0.11
- Date: 20210702. Added IVOCOXY to mapper; updated representative compounds for IVOCP6ARO, SVOCN1, and SVOCP0 in SPECIATE.

## Version 0.1 
- Date: 20210621. initial mapper and species properties for CRACMM.
